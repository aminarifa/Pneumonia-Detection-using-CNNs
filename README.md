# PneumoniaDetection
This project aims at building an algorithm for the automatic identification of pneumonia from chest X-rays by using Deep Learning. The Dataset was obtained from Kaggle. 
Standard image processing techniques, augmentation (small dataset size), over sampling (of minority class, as dataset was imbalanced) and Tranfer Learning were employed in the project.
A F1-score of 0.92 was obtained.
